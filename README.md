## Data Collection and Preparation:
* Administrative information 
* Workload information 
* Mutual evaluation information 
## Feature Engineering:
* First, we have people with high 'last_evaluation' but low 'satisfaction'. Maybe these people were overqualified, frustrated, or unhappy in some other way.
* Next, we have people with low 'last_evaluation' and medium 'satisfaction'. These were probably underperformers or poor cultural fits.
* Finally, we have people with high 'last_evaluation' and high 'satisfaction'. Perhaps these were overachievers who found better offers elsewhere.
## Model Selection:
* Several machine learning algorithms can be used for this type of prediction, including:
* Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model that predicts the probability of an employee leaving.
* Random Forest: A powerful ensemble method that can capture complex relationships in the data.
* Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Another ensemble method that often provides high accuracy.
* The choice of model depends on the specific data and the desired balance between accuracy and interpretability.
## Model Training and Evaluation:
* Split the data: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance1 on unseen data. 
* Train the model: Use the training data to train the chosen algorithm.
* Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as:
* Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model's predictions.
* Precision: Proportion of correctly predicted leavers out of all employees predicted to leave.
* Recall: Proportion of correctly predicted leavers out of all actual leavers.
* AUC-ROC: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between leavers and stayers.
## Model Deployment and Monitoring:
* Deploy the model: Integrate the model into your HR systems to predict the probability of current employees leaving.
* Monitor the model: Regularly track the model's performance and retrain it as needed to maintain accuracy.
